	<abstract>
	<t>Most protocols support users under domain names, but HTTP does
	not.  Usage patterns in the wild do suggest a desire to have this
	facilitated.  This specification defines a header for this purpose,
	orthogonal to any authentication or authorisation concerns.</t>

<section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">

<t>Most protocols support Network Access Identifiers
<xref target="RFC7542"/> like john@example.com to
identify users like john within domains such as example.com.  The URI format
for HTTP can express [Section 2.7.1 of <xref target="RFC7230"/>]
such authority sections, and many online applications
seem to want to address individual users, but HTTP lacks the customary
representation for user names.  This specification therefore introduces
a new header field, similar to the "Host" header field.</t>

<t>Historically, user names have been coupled to (Basic and Digest)
authentication.  This is not generally correct; the user name in the URI
represents a resource, not an (authenticating) visitor.  By using a new
header field, this specification allows authentication to be orthogonal
to resource selection.</t>

<t>Browsers have supported (Basic and Digest) authentication with a scheme
of "user:password" in the authority section of URIs.  This has now been
deprecated [Section 3.2.1 of <xref target="RFC3986"/>] but the form with
just "user" and no ":password" is still open to use.  Various HTTP clients
have different handling of this form, sometimes flagging it incorrectly as
a security hazard, which is another reason to specify what to do.</t>

<t>TODO: Erratum #5964 against RFC 7230,
https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid5964</t>

<t>The purpose of this specification is to provide a clear meaning to a URI with
a user name portion, and treat it similar to the host name.</t>

</section>


<section title="The HTTP User-View Header" anchor="header">

<t>The "User-View" header field provides the user name as part of
the authority that selects a name scope.  The value usually is taken
from the authority section [Section 3.2 of <xref target="RFC3986"/>]
which MUST NOT include a colon and/or a password.  An empty header value
is valid; it indicates absense of a user name, and additionally signals
support for the User-View header.</t>

<t>The User-View header value holds
precisely one value with the following ABNF grammar:
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
User-View = 0*( unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims )
]]></artwork></figure>
The referenced non-terminals are as for URIs <xref target="RFC3986"/>.
Zeal in use of the "pct-encoded" non-terminal for plain characters that
have a direct representation MAY be considered an attempted attack.</t>

<t>The User-View header MAY occur in requests and responses, but
MUST NOT be included in trailers [Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC7230"/>].
It is normal for HTTP to ignore unrecognised headers
[Section 3.2.1 of <xref target="RFC7230"/>].
Intermediate such as proxies and caches MUST NOT add, remove or modify the
User-View header.</t>

</section>


<section title="Protocol Handling of HTTP User-View" anchor="protocol">

<t>User agents SHOULD render user names in authority sections whenever
they render host names, though it is helpful if it stands out graphically
[Section 7.6 of <xref target="RFC3986"/>].
User agents SHOULD NOT remove user names from the URI except when a
response indicates a new value.
User agents MAY remove the "@" (U+0040) symbol from a URI when the
preceding user name is empty.  User agents SHOULD refuse URIs with
the deprecated form "user:password" but MUST NOT complain about a
user name that does not hold a ":" (U+003A) symbol.</t>

<t>When the User-View header is included in a response, it declares
a reference point for relative references
[Section 4.2 of <xref target="RFC3986"/>], but this information MUST
be ignored by any reference that mentions an authority component,
with or without a userinfo sub-component.  However, when constructing
an absolute URI from a relative URI such as in an HTTP redirect
[Section 6.4 of <xref target="RFC7231"/>],
without an authority component, a User-View header in a response MUST
be considered the source of a user name to include in the newly formed
URI.  Likewise, in the same situation MUST the absense of a User-View
header field cause the removal of the user name from the newly formed
URI.  Other than this, the User-View header field is not automatically
copied from a redirection response to a follow-up request.</t>

<t>HTTP servers MAY redirect a request to a location that encodes the
same or another user name in the path of the URI, while setting the User-View
header to a new value.  This enables HTTP servers to define a local path syntax
for user names, even when users and tools can approach them without knowing
about this local convention.</t>

</section>

<section title="Caching Behaviour" anchor="cache">

<t>The privacy or security of an HTTP resource is not impacted by the
use of a User-View header.  This is because User-View is about
resource location.  Its value has no bearing on authentication
or authorisation.</t>

<t>HTTP caches <xref target="RFC7234"/>
need to distinguish responses when they are requested with different
User-View header values.  Given a User-View header in a request, the Vary
header [Section 7.1.4 of <xref target="RFC7231"/>] MUST be present, and
MUST either be valued "*" or list the "user-view" name, as part of any
response that has been influenced by the User-View header.  Software
or configurations that ignore the User-View header are not subjected
to this requirement.</t>

<section title="IANA Considerations" anchor="iana">

<t>IANA adds the following entry to the Message Headers registry:
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Header Field Name   Template   Protocol   Status    Reference
------------------  ---------  ---------  -------   ----------
User-View                      http       TBD       TBD:THIS_SPEC
]]></artwork></figure>
</t>

</section>

<section title="Security Considerations">

<t>The User-View header field as defined herein is orthogonal to issues of
authentication or authorisation, and so it implies no security concerns.</t>

<!-- blablabla
<t>These user names refine the model of resource addressing for HTTP,
but any concerns related to privacy or secrecy of resources are already
habitually addressed in HTTP servers.  This habit MUST be applied to
this new, more refined resource addressing model.</t>
