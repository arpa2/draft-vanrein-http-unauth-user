<section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">

<t>Many protocols support global identities like john@example.com to
identify users like john under domains such as example.com.  The URI format
for HTTP can express [Section 2.7.1 of <xref target="RFC7230"/>]
such authority components, with an intended interpretation of locating
user-specific resources.  Many online applications
publish about individual users, but there is no standard in HTTP to
express user names to address them.  This specification therefore introduces
a header "User", in close parallel to the "Host" header.</t>

<t>Some current URIs for HTTP have used the userinfo field in the URI
to express an authentication user, in spite of the intended use
to refine the authority information.  This conflates the user part
of the resource with the (authenticated) client-side identity.  This
specification makes authentication and resource user two orthogonal concepts,
and specifies a clear relation to the URI format.</t>

<!--
auth-part: should mean authority, but reads as authentication...
-->

<t>Orthogonality yields a generalisation, but voluntary conflation of the user
concepts remains possible, and may even be useful as default behaviour.
Servers can be configured with resource users that demand
authentication with the same client name; they may even accept authentication
as a bypass to a resource user.  Clients may accept authentication requests
and use their submitted resource user as a hint to the authentication user.</t>

<t>Orthogonal concepts can however be untied to support advanced use cases, of
which these practices are a specific form.  Servers may welcome members to
authenticate against a shared/group resource.  Clients treat the resource
user as part of the realm identity and can use it to locate the customary
authentication user for that realm.  Credentials need not be tied to the
server, so it is possible to "bring your own identity" by facilitating
realm crossover for credentials.</t>

<!-- MOVED DOWN TO SEPARATE SECTIONS
<t>When user agents support (Basic and Digest) authentication through URIs,
they usually allow a "user:password" format in the authority section of URIs.
This practice has been
deprecated [Section 3.2.1 of <xref target="RFC3986"/>] but the form with
just "user" and no ":password" continues to be acceptable.  Different user
agents show varied handling for this form, sometimes flagging it incorrectly as
a security hazard, which also motivates a specification for proper handling.</t>

<t>The purpose of this specification is to define clear meaning for http and

<section title="The HTTP User Header" anchor="header">

<t>The "User" header field provides an aspect of the desired
resource name scope.  The value can be inserted by software or be taken
from the visible portion of the userinfo component
[Section 3.2 of <xref target="RFC3986"/>]
of the target URI but it MUST NOT include a ":" colon (U+003a) character.</t>

<t>The User header value holds
precisely one value with the following ABNF grammar:
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
User = *( unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims )
]]></artwork></figure>
The referenced non-terminals are as for URIs <xref target="RFC3986"/>
and can be directly included in the quoted-string header form; a plain token
cannot express "(", ")", "=", ";" and "," without escaping
[Section 3.2.6 of <xref target="RFC7230"/>].</t>

<!--

CHARACTER SETS FOR URI-USERINFO AND NAI COMPARED:

Do not use this; it is up to the server to constrain the grammar of
the userinfo to something like a NAI.  It does make sense, but after
removal of escapes, so character sets matter less.

	URI \ NAI ::= "(" / ")" / "," / ";"
	NAI \ URI ::= "#" / "%" / "/" / "?" / "^" / "`" / "{" / "|" "}"
		    \ UTF8-xtra-char [defined in RFC 7542]

ALSO, A SYNTAX DIFFERENCE:

	In a URI, dots can be anywhere.

	In a NAI, dots separate non-empty character sequences.

ARE THERE DIFFERENCES IN CASE SENSITIVITY?

MAYBE:

	- Define our own characters, including ASCII pct-encoded
	- Use UTF8-xtra-char from RFC 7542 for UTF-8 specifics
	- Note that RFC 7542 does not pct-encode UTF-8

<section title="URI with User Information" anchor="uri">

<t>This section is informative.</t>

<t>The use of a user name in the authority component of a URI is a general
concept, already used for addressing users with SMTP,
SIP, XMPP and many other protocols.  By allowing users in HTTP resource
names, better crossover of identities with these protocols can be
achieved.  Unlike server-specific user name mapping conventions, the specified
generic meaning of URI userinfo as part of the authority information enables
such crossovers to be automated.</t>

<t>There is a current practice of writing an authentication name in
the userinfo portion of a URI.  This can be useful if it adds
Basic authentication to the first request; Basic can do
this because it does not incorporate a server-sent challenge.</t>

<t>Having never been standardised, the mechanistic side of this practice is
highly diverse, and URIs are far from portable between browsers or even the
various places where they occur within one browser.  As a result, these URIs
cannot be spread freely and their usage pattern is dedicated to the client
software in use.  On grounds of this immobility, it would have been sufficient
to not break this practice.  What this specification does is completely
support [<xref target="compat.basic"/>] this pattern as a special case.</t>

<t>This specification follows the URI's intention of the userinfo field,
and prescribes copying its value into the User header.  It will however
remove anything from a colon onward, to suppress the portion of userinfo
that is prescribed to not be rendered.</t>

<t>Both the general userinfo format and the removal of anything starting
from a colon may lead to an empty string as the User header value.
Servers may interpret this empty User header as they see fit;
the underlying resource may be a default page, for example one
that asks for a user name to redirect to.  After client
authentication, such a page may list user names that
would be accessible.</t>

</section>


<section title="Protocol Handling of URI and User" anchor="protocol">

<t>User agents are supposed to render userinfo in the target URI
(up to the first colon ":" (U+003a)
if it contains any [Section 3.2.1 of <xref target="RFC3986"/>])
where it may be helpful if it stands out graphically
[Section 7.6 of <xref target="RFC3986"/>].
User agents SHOULD NOT remove userinfo from the target URI.</t>

<t>Compliant user agents MUST pass userinfo in the target URI
(up to the first colon ":" (U+003a) if it contains any) as a User
header field if, and only if, the target URI contains a userinfo part.</t>

<t>The User header MAY appear in requests and MUST NOT occur in responses.
<!-- also not in trailers [Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC7230"/>].  -->
When sending it, the user agent SHOULD generate User as the next header field after Host.
Transparent intermediates such as proxies and caches MUST NOT add,
remove or modify the User header.  The CONNECT method and Host header
both exclude this information, so the User header complements them.</t>

<t>Compliant servers MAY ignore the User header
[Section 3.2.1 of <xref target="RFC7230"/>] and they MAY impose a more
restrictive grammar (like a NAI's utf8-username <xref target="RFC7542"/>)
than the URI syntax before further processing it.  When they do use it,
the Effective Request URI [Section 5.5 of <xref target="RFC7230"/>]
MUST be constructed with the userinfo and the "@" at delimiter (U+0040)
prefixed to the host name and optional port.  Realms are specific to
an authority section [Section 2.2 of <xref target="RFC7235"/>]
and so a realm never spans across different userinfo values.</t>

<t>As a result of a consistent translation of any User header value
into the Effective Request URI, the server would map consistently to
resources.  It is merely enabled to include a User header as an
extra input variable to this mapping to resources.</t>

<t>HTTP caches <xref target="RFC7234"/> derive no privacy or
security concerns from the User header, but they do need to
differentiate requests based on it.  To accommodate that,
the Vary header [Section 7.1.4 of <xref target="RFC7231"/>] MUST
be generated by the server in the matching response, and the header
MUST either be a single "*" star (U+002a) or list the "User" name,
for all responses whose processing was influenced by the
User header.  This requirement has no bearing on software and
configurations that ignore the User header.</t>

<t>During redirects or other traversals to relative HTTP URIs, compliant
user agents MUST overwrite the userinfo in the target URI when the new URI
specifies an authority component, and MUST keep it otherwise.</t>

</section>

<section title="Environment Variable with Local User" anchor="envvar">

<t>The following variable SHOULD be passed to applications that
run on top of the HTTP stack in a server:
<list style="hanging" hangIndent="6">
<t hangText="LOCAL_USER">gives the HTTP User header value
	after syntax checking and percent-decoding.  Like the customary
	variables HTTP_HOST and PATH_INFO, this specifies the
	resource being requested.  The HTTP_USER header does not
	describe the identity of the client-side user, which usually
	lands in a variable REMOTE_USER after authentication.</t>
</list></t>

</section>

<section title="Orthogonality of Authentication (Example)" anchor="ortho">

<t>This section is informative.</t>

<t>The authority user in a URI refines the server's resource name space,
and the server is free to distinguish this resource user from an
authenticated client identity.  The example below demonstrates the expressive
power gained by treating these user concepts as separate, in an advanced
pattern of use in which an individual user accesses a group resource.
This advanced binding between the group resource and an authenticated client
can build on access control lists.</t>

<t>John and Mary both work at the Sales department of Example, Inc and
John has written a document that he wants Mary to review.  Mary opens a
link to the document name space under the shared sales account at
https://sales@example.com/docs and her user agent sends:
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
GET /docs HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User: sales
]]></artwork></figure>
The server redirects to add a slash, and when this is specific to
the sales name space, it must inform caches about this with the Vary header:
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: /docs/
Vary: User
]]></artwork></figure>
Since the new location lacks an authority component, this part is retained
from the referring URI, and the user agent redirects to
https://sales@example.com/docs/ by sending:
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
GET /docs/ HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User: sales
]]></artwork></figure>
By this time, the server runs into access control, and decides that it
needs an authenticated user identity.  To this end, it responds with a
challenge to the "Documents" realm:
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: KnockKnock realm="Documents"
Vary: User
]]></artwork></figure>
Mary's user agent needs to collect credentials, and may hint at the user
name "sales" from the URI but, this being the name of a shared resource,
Mary has no fitting credentials and instead authenticates as "mary":
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
GET /docs/ HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User: sales
Authorization: KnockKnock realm="Documents", user="mary", ...
]]></artwork></figure>
At some point, the server accepts Mary's authentication and
proceeds to access control.  This phase checks if user "mary" may
access realm "Documents" of "https://sales@example.com" by checking
that Mary works for the Sales department.  Once this is assured,
the server returns the requested document list:
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Vary: User
Content-Type: text/html

...
<a href="/docs/review.cgi?docid=123">Review 123 now</a>
...
]]></artwork></figure>
Mary clicks on the link to /docs/review.cgi?docid=123 and her user agent
sees a relative reference with no authority component, so this is
again reused from the referring URI.  The new URI is
https://sales@example.com/docs/review.cgi?docid=123 
with same root https://sales@example.com
for which Mary has established credentials,
so the same realm can be tried.  The user agent therefore sends:
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
GET /docs/review.cgi?docid=123 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User: sales
Authorization: KnockKnock realm="Documents", user="mary", ...
]]></artwork></figure>
After access control, the server starts the CGI script with environment
variables LOCAL_USER=sales and REMOTE_USER=mary of which only the latter
is an authenticated result.  The script interprets the LOCAL_USER as a
group account and the REMOTE_USER as the acting group member, and returns
a page for review of the document and Mary can get to work.</t>

<section title="Compatibility with Basic Authentication" anchor="compat.basic">

<t>This appendix is informative.</t>

<t>Basic authentication is regularly used as a quick and easy HTTP
authentication technique.  Several user agents continue to support it with
the "user:password@" URI prefix to a hostname, despite its deprecation
[Section 3.2.1 of <xref target="RFC3986"/>].
This specification imposes no new constraints on this practice; it merely
prescribes to send the User header field, and leaves it to client software
whether it also sends Basic authentication.</t>

<t>The mapping from authority names to resources is the prerogative
of the server.  A server supportive of resource selection through Basic
authentication could ignore the User header field and still comply with
this specification.  A server that does recognise the User header field would
use it to locate a resource, before deciding about access control to that
resource; it may subsequently require authentication, and select schemes
that could be supported.  At this time, it may or may not welcome an added
Basic authentication attempt.  All this depends on server configuration.</t>

<t>This flexibility can support a transition from Basic authentication to
User headers on the server, and allows client software to also migrate by
first adding the User header, and later supporting the advanced uses by
allowing differentiation between resource user and authentication user.
Server administrators have a free choice whether to gradually phase out
older clients or to continue to support them.</t>

<t>Sending both the User header and Basic authentication is only to be
expected from user agents who conflate authority userinfo with authentication
user.  Such user agents will be less flexible, and will not be able to
support more advanced usage patterns that separate these concepts, such as
shared/group resources addressed with the User header field and, when desired,
authentication through an independent set of headers.  Among the tools to
drive separate authentication could be the negotiation of more advanced
mechanisms, even just Digest authentication.</t>

</section>

<section title="Compatibility with RESTful Patterns" anchor="compat.rest">

<t>This appendix is informative.</t>

<t>Whether and how the User header is interpreted is the prerogative of
the server.  The server will translate resources in the same manner when
provided with the same User header, and may do so without regard for the
method used.  The main concern is now if it will be addressed in the same
manner in every case.  This depends on the user agents.</t>

<t>Development environments make sending the User header field simple,
so application support is as easy as the applications are flexible.
Binary user agents and ones that may lag behind in updates
do however call for backward compatibility support of consistent
translation to resources.</t>

<t>Backward compatibility can be guaranteed for host names that always
require a User header; such resources may be described with a URI holding
a (possibly empty) userinfo field.  Failure to send a User header to
such resources when the URI holds one can be assumed to have originated
from a user agent that fails to support it.  When an offer for Basic authentication
is presented, it may be interpreted as the conflated approach to userinfo, and
treated as a substitute for the User header.  If neither is offered, then an
error may be reported or control redirected to another means of selecting
a resource user, perhaps through an alternate local naming convention.</t>

<t>This indicates that the server is able to detect inconsistent tranlation
risks, and avoid accidentally binding a request to an unintended resource
as a result of a missing User header.</t>

</section>

<section title="Compatibility with Caching" anchor="compat.cache">

<t>This appendix is informative.</t>

<t>Whether and how the User header is used to find resources is the
prerogative of their server.  A conservative cache design might insert
the User header value in request URIs, but lose the capability of
seeing the equivalence of a resource as perceived by the server.
The inclusion of the name "User" in the Vary header of the response
adds explicit non-equivalence information, and thereby provides a more
accurate cache controlling instruction.</t>

<t>Whether a result is "private" is independent of the User header, as that
only signifies a refinement of the resource name space on the server.
The rules that signify authentication as default indicator of privacy
is orthogonal to the User header.  Independent inclusion of Basic
authentication may still invalidate caching, but not as a result of this
specification.</t>
