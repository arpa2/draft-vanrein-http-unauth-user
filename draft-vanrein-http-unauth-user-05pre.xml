	<t>Many protocols support users under domain names, but HTTP does
	not.  <!-- Usage patterns in the wild do suggest a desire to have this
	facility. -->  This specification defines a header for user names,
	independent of authenticated identities, and a link to userinfo in
	HTTP URIs.  This intergrates naturally with HTTP, and results in a
	more refined resource authentication model, in support of advanced
	usage scenarios.</t>

<section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">

<t>Many protocols support global identities like john@example.com to
represent users like john under domains such as example.com.  The URI format
for HTTP can express [Section 2.7.1 of <xref target="RFC7230"/>]
such authority components (with a userid named "resource user" herein),
with an intended interpretation of locating
user-specific resources.  Many online applications
publish resources on individual users, but there is no standard in HTTP to
express user names to address them.  This specification adds that through
a header "User", closely paralleling the "Host" header.</t>

<t>Some current URIs for HTTP have used the userinfo field in the URI
to express an authentication user (named "client identity" herein),
in spite of the intended use to refine the authority information.
This conflates the resource user with the client identity.
This specification defines client identity and resource user as
orthogonal concepts, and specifies a clear relation to the URI format.</t>

<!--
auth-part: should mean authority, but reads as authentication...
-->

<t>Orthogonality yields a generalisation, but voluntary conflation of
client identity and resource user
remains possible.  In fact, software may use it as default behaviour.
Servers can be configured with resource users that demand
authentication with the same client identity; they may even accept
authentication with a client identity as a bypass to the same resource user.
Clients may accept authentication requests
and use the resource user from the target URI as a hint to the expected
client identity.</t>

<t>Orthogonal concepts can however be untied to support advanced use cases.
Servers may use resource users to identify groups and welcome members to
authenticate against such a group resource.  
While authenticating, client identities can be drawn
from another domain, so it is possible to "bring your own identity" as long
as the server can rely on a mechanism of realm crossover for credentials.</t>

<t>TOBEREMOVED: We have designed two mechanisms for realm crossover in
other specifications; SXOVER is a SASL mechanism for realm crossover via a
Diameter backend, which can be provisioned to user agents through HTTP SASL;
KXOVER is a Kerberos mechanism that is taken care of in the KDC.  Both rely
on DNSSEC, DANE and TLS.</t>

<!-- MOVED DOWN TO SEPARATE SECTIONS
<t>When user agents support (Basic and Digest) authentication through URIs,
they usually allow a "user:password" format in the authority section of URIs.
This practice has been
deprecated [Section 3.2.1 of <xref target="RFC3986"/>] but the form with
just "user" and no ":password" continues to be acceptable.  Different user
agents show varied handling for this form, sometimes flagging it incorrectly as
a security hazard, which also motivates a specification for proper handling.</t>

<t>The purpose of this specification is to define clear meaning for http and

<section title="Definition of the HTTP User Header" anchor="header">

<t>The "User" header carries a resource user as part of the requested
authority, and therefore refines the resource name scope.
The value can be explicitly inserted <!-- by software --> or be <!-- taken
from the visible portion of the userinfo component
[Section 3.2 of <xref target="RFC3986"/>]
of -->
the user in the userinfo component of
the target URI.</t>

<t>The User header value holds
precisely one value with the following ABNF grammar:
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
User = *( unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims )
]]></artwork></figure>
The referenced non-terminals are as for URIs <xref target="RFC3986"/>
and can be directly included in the quoted-string header form; a plain token
cannot express "(", ")", "=", ";" and "," without escaping
[Section 3.2.6 of <xref target="RFC7230"/>].
Note that the header MUST NOT include a ":" colon (U+003a) character.</t>

<!--

CHARACTER SETS FOR URI-USERINFO AND HTTP-HEADER COMPARED:

This is useful to know if the userinfo can be inserted into the User
header without further ado.

<!--

CHARACTER SETS FOR URI-USERINFO AND NAI COMPARED:

Do not use this; it is up to the server to constrain the grammar of
the userinfo to something like a NAI.  It does make sense, but after
removal of escapes, so character sets matter less.

	URI \ NAI ::= "(" / ")" / "," / ";"
	NAI \ URI ::= "#" / "%" / "/" / "?" / "^" / "`" / "{" / "|" "}"
		    \ UTF8-xtra-char [defined in RFC 7542]

ALSO, A SYNTAX DIFFERENCE:

	In a URI, dots can be anywhere.

	In a NAI, dots separate non-empty character sequences.

ARE THERE DIFFERENCES IN CASE SENSITIVITY?

MAYBE:

	- Define our own characters, including ASCII pct-encoded
	- Use UTF8-xtra-char from RFC 7542 for UTF-8 specifics
	- Note that RFC 7542 does not pct-encode UTF-8

<section title="URI with Resource User" anchor="uri">

<t>This section is informative.</t>

<t>Naming a user in the authority component of a URI is a general
idea, already used for addressing users with SMTP,
SIP, XMPP and many other protocols.  The addition of users in the URIs for HTTP,
a refined resource name is provided,
and better crossover of identities with these protocols can be
achieved.  Unlike server-specific user name mapping conventions, the specified
generic meaning of URI userinfo as part of the authority information enables
such crossovers to be automated.</t>

<t>There is a current practice of writing a client identity in
the userinfo portion of a URI.  This is considered useful if it adds
Basic authentication to the first request; Basic can do
this because it does not incorporate a server-sent challenge.</t>

<t>Having never been standardised, the mechanistic side of this practice is
highly diverse, and URIs are far from portable between browsers or even the
various places where they occur within one browser.  As a result, these URIs
cannot be distributed freely and their usage pattern is dedicated to the client
software in use.  This specification does completely
support [<xref target="compat.basic"/>] this pattern as a special case.</t>

<t>This specification follows the URI's intention of the userinfo field,
and prescribes copying its value into the User header.  It will however
remove anything from a colon onward, to suppress the portion of userinfo
that should not be rendered [Section 3.2.1 of <xref target="RFC3986"/>]
as well as a colon hinting at an empty password.</t>

<!-- Drop: Not saying anything...
<t>Both the general userinfo format and the removal of anything starting
from a colon may lead to an empty string as the User header value.
Servers may interpret this empty User header as they see fit;
the underlying resource may be a default page, for example one
that asks for a user name to redirect to.  After client
authentication, such a page may list user names that
would be accessible.</t>
-->

</section>


<section title="Protocol Handling of URI and User Header" anchor="protocol">

<!--
Drop rendering suggestions.  This specification deals with URIs and
leaves GUIs to the specialists (who also see other, possibly conflicting
concerns.
-->

<!--
<t>Compliant user agents MUST render userinfo from the target URI
(up to but excluding the first colon ":" (U+003a)
if it contains any [Section 3.2.1 of <xref target="RFC3986"/>])
along with the remainder of the authority section,
where it is considered helpful if the userinfo stands out graphically
[Section 7.6 of <xref target="RFC3986"/>].</t>
-->

<t>Compliant user agents MUST pass userinfo from the target URI
(up to but excluding the first colon ":" (U+003a) if it contains any) as a User
header field if, and only if, the target URI contains a userinfo part.
They MUST NOT remove userinfo from the target URI during this process.
Empty userinfo MUST be treated as any other userinfo string.</t>

<t>The User header MAY appear in requests and MUST NOT occur in responses.
<!-- also not in trailers [Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC7230"/>].  -->
When sending it, the user agent SHOULD generate User as the next header field after Host.
Transparent intermediates such as proxies and caches MUST NOT add,
remove or modify the User header.  The CONNECT method and Host header
both exclude this information, so the User header complements them.</t>

<t>Compliant servers MAY ignore the User header
[Section 3.2.1 of <xref target="RFC7230"/>] and they MAY impose a more
restrictive grammar (like a NAI's utf8-username <xref target="RFC7542"/>)
than the URI syntax before further processing it.  When they do use it,
the Effective Request URI [Section 5.5 of <xref target="RFC7230"/>]
MUST be constructed with the userinfo and the "@" at delimiter (U+0040)
prefixed to the host name and optional port.  Realms are specific to
an authority section [Section 2.2 of <xref target="RFC7235"/>]
and so a realm never spans across different userinfo values.</t>

<t>As a result of a consistent translation of any User header value
into the Effective Request URI, the server would map consistently to
resources.  It is merely enabled to include a User header as an
extra input variable to this mapping to resources.</t>

<t>HTTP caches <xref target="RFC7234"/> need to
differentiate requests based on the User header.  To accommodate that,
the Vary header [Section 7.1.4 of <xref target="RFC7231"/>] MUST
be generated by the server in the matching response, and the header
MUST either be a single "*" star (U+002a) or list the "User" name,
for all responses whose processing was influenced by the
User header.  This requirement has no bearing on software and
configurations that ignore the User header.</t>

<t>Compliant user agents MUST NOT change the support of the User header
depending on the source of a reference; be it a redirect form a server,
a click in a hyperlinked document, a script or a part of a browser interface
or an external source.  When processing URIs that are relative to
the context of a previous URI, compliant
user agents MUST replace the userinfo in the target URI when the new URI
specifies an authority component, and MUST keep it otherwise.</t>

</section>

<section title="The Logic of User in HTTP" anchor="logical">

<t>This section is informative.</t>

<t>HTTP structures a number of things around the authority component of
its URIs, and the addition of resource users in this position form a
logical extension.  This leads to improved user experiences.</t>

<t>Realms are identified by a scheme, the authority and a descriptive string
passed with authentication challenges.  Clients can use this combination to
decide about a user identity to present to a server; it is common for
people to have roles relative to one another, and the standard definition
of realm identity allows the user agent to select an identity to match
the role for the remote party.  This can even be used for credentials
passed in the TLS handshake, such as X.509 certificates.</t>

<t>A similar logic is found for robot exclusion files.  They are found
at a path /robots.txt for a given scheme and authority.  The inclusion
of the resource user in the authority enables personal pages to each
have their own robot exclusion file.</t>

<t>More futuristic would be a suggestion that a server may relay connections
to user-operated web servers on the basis of the resource user; this is once
again an intended use of the authority field.  It may not be possible under
current specifications yet, but HTTP with User header can support it as
soon as TLS can.</t>

</section>

<section title="Environment Variable with Local User" anchor="envvar">

<t>The following variable SHOULD be passed to applications that
run on top of the HTTP stack in a server:
<list style="hanging" hangIndent="6">
<t hangText="LOCAL_USER">gives the HTTP User header value
	after syntax checking and percent-decoding.  If used at all,
	it MUST be treated as a resource user.  This header does not
	describe the authenticated client identity, which is usually
	passed in a variable REMOTE_USER.</t>
</list></t>

</section>

<section title="Orthogonality of Authentication (Example)" anchor="ortho">

<t>This section is informative.</t>

<t>This section provides an example of an advanced use case.  Not only does
this use the resource user to locate a shared server account, it is also
distinct from the client identity used during authentication.  Whether the
client identity is welcomed by the resource user is determined with an
access control list.  Furthermore, this example shows the logic of a
realm identity that involves the resource user in finding the right
client identity to the contacted resource user.</t>

<t>John and Mary are both part of the Sales group of Example, Inc and
John has written a document that he wants Mary to review.  Mary opens a
link to the document name space under the group's shared account "sales"
at https://sales@example.com/docs and her user agent sends:
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
GET /docs HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User: sales
]]></artwork></figure>
The server redirects to add a slash, and when this is specific to
the sales name space, it must inform caches about this with the Vary header:
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: /docs/
Vary: User
]]></artwork></figure>
Since the new location lacks an authority component, this part is retained
from the referring URI, and the user agent redirects to
https://sales@example.com/docs/ by sending:
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
GET /docs/ HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User: sales
]]></artwork></figure>
By this time, the server runs into access control, and decides that it
needs an authenticated user identity.  To this end, it responds with a
challenge to the "Documents" realm:
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: KnockKnock realm="Documents"
Vary: User
]]></artwork></figure>
Mary's user agent needs to collect credentials, and may hint at the user
name "sales" from the URI but, this being the name of a shared resource,
Mary has no fitting credentials and instead authenticates with client
identity "mary":
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
GET /docs/ HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User: sales
Authorization: KnockKnock realm="Documents", user="mary", ...
]]></artwork></figure>
At some point, the server accepts Mary's authentication and
proceeds to access control.  This phase checks if client identity "mary" may
access realm "Documents" of "https://sales@example.com" by checking
that Mary works for the Sales department.  Once this is assured,
the server returns the requested document list:
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Vary: User
Content-Type: text/html

...
<a href="/docs/review.cgi?docid=123">Review 123 now</a>
...
]]></artwork></figure>
Mary clicks on the link to /docs/review.cgi?docid=123 and her user agent
sees a relative reference with no authority component, so this is
again reused from the referring URI.  The new URI is
https://sales@example.com/docs/review.cgi?docid=123 
with same root https://sales@example.com
for which Mary has an authenticated client identity,
so the same "Documents" realm can be tried.  The user agent therefore sends:
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
GET /docs/review.cgi?docid=123 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User: sales
Authorization: KnockKnock realm="Documents", user="mary", ...
]]></artwork></figure>
After access control, the server starts the CGI script with environment
variables LOCAL_USER=sales and REMOTE_USER=mary for the resource user and
authenticated client identity, respectively.
The script interprets the LOCAL_USER as a
group account and the REMOTE_USER as the acting group member, and returns
a page for review of the document and Mary can get to work.</t>

<section title="Compatibility with Basic Authentication" anchor="compat.basic">

<t>This appendix is informative.</t>

<t>Basic authentication is regularly used as a quick and easy HTTP
authentication technique.  Several user agents continue to support it with
the "user:password@" URI prefix to a hostname, despite its deprecation
[Section 3.2.1 of <xref target="RFC3986"/>].
This specification imposes no new constraints on this practice; it merely
prescribes sending the User header field, and leaves it to client software
whether to also sends Basic authentication.</t>

<t>The mapping from HTTP requests to resources is the prerogative
of the server.  A server supportive of resource selection through Basic
authentication could ignore the User header field and still comply with
this specification.  A server that does recognise the User header field would
use it to locate a resource, before deciding about access control to that
resource; it may subsequently require authentication, and select schemes
that could be supported.  At this time, it may or may not welcome an added
Basic authentication attempt.  All this depends on server configuration.</t>

<t>This flexibility can support a transition from Basic authentication to
User headers on the server, and allows client software to also migrate by
first adding the User header, and later supporting the advanced uses by
allowing differentiation between resource user and client identity.
Server administrators have a free choice whether to gradually phase out
older clients or to continue to support them.</t>

<t>Sending both the User header and Basic authentication is only to be
expected from user agents who conflate resource user with client identity.
Such user agents will be less flexible, and will not be able to
support more advanced usage patterns that separate these concepts, such as
shared/group resources addressed with the User header field and, when desired,
authentication through a set of other headers.</t>

</section>

<section title="Compatibility with RESTful Patterns" anchor="compat.rest">

<t>This appendix is informative.</t>

<t>Whether and how the User header is interpreted is the prerogative of
the server.  The server will translate resources in the same manner when
provided with the same User header, and may do so without regard for the
HTTP method.  The main concern is now if it will be addressed in the same
manner in every case.  This depends on the user agents.</t>

<t>Development environments make sending the User header field simple,
so application support is as easy as the applications are flexible.
Binary user agents and ones that may lag behind in updates
do however call for backward compatibility support of consistent
translation to resources.</t>

<t>Backward compatibility can be guaranteed for host names that always
require a User header; all resources would be described with URIs having
a (possibly empty) userinfo field.  Failure to send a User header to
such resources when the URI holds userinfo indicates that the user agent
fails to support the User header.  When an offer for Basic authentication
is presented, it may be interpreted as the conflated approach to userinfo, and
treated as a substitute for the User header.  If neither is offered, then an
error may be reported or control redirected to another means of selecting
a resource user, perhaps through an alternate local naming convention.</t>

<t>This indicates that the server is able to detect inconsistent tranlation
risks, and avoid accidentally binding a request to an unintended resource
as a result of a missing User header.</t>

</section>

<section title="Compatibility with Caching" anchor="compat.cache">

<t>This appendix is informative.</t>

<t>Whether and how the User header is used to find resources is the
prerogative of their server.  A conservative cache design might insert
the User header value in request URIs, but lose the capability of
seeing the equivalence of a resource as perceived by the server.
The inclusion of the name "User" in the Vary header of the response
adds explicit non-equivalence information, and thereby provides a more
accurate cache controlling instruction.</t>

<t>Whether a result is "private" is independent of the User header, as that
only signifies a refinement of the resource name space on the server.
The rules that signify authentication as default indicator of privacy
is orthogonal to the User header.  Independent inclusion of Basic
authentication may still invalidate caching, but not as a result of this
specification.</t>

<t>User agents that send Basic authentication will invalidate intermediate
caching.  When an empty password is used to select a resource user, it would
improve caching performance to switch from Basic authentication to the
User header.</t>
