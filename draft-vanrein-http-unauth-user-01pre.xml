	<t>Most protocols support users under domain names, but HTTP is an
	exception.  Given that it is useful to have this facility for HTTP
	and that it merely requires a consistent treatment by clients, we
	specify how to map such URI patterns to HTTP Requests.</t>

<section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">

<t>Most protocols support Network Access Identifiers like john@example.com to
identify users like john within domains such as example.com.  The URI format
for HTTP can express such authority sections, and many online applications
seem to want to address individual users, but HTTP offers no representation
for user names.  This specification solves that with a new header.</t>

<t>Historically, user names have been derived from (Basic and Digest)
authentication.  This is not generally correct; the user name in the URI
represents the resource, not the visitor.  The use of a new header allows
indepedency between authentication and resource viewing.</t>

<t>Browsers have supported (Basic and Digest) authentication with a scheme
of "user:password" in the authority section of URIs.  This has now been
deprecated [Section 3.2.1 of <xref target="RFC3986"/>] but the form with
just "user" but not ":password" is still open to use.  Various HTTP clients
have different handling of this form, sometimes flagging it incorrectly as
a security hazard, which is another reason to specify what to do.</t>

<t>The purpose of this specification is to give a clear meaning to a URI with
a user name portion, but with no password.  Such a URI may be implemented by
variation of the HTTP resource space, just as is often done for host name.</t>

</section>


<section title="The HTTP User-View Header" anchor="header">

<t>The "User-View" header field in a request provides the user name
from the target URI.  The value is taken from the userinfo in the 
authority section [Section 3.2 of <xref target="RFC3986"/>] which
MUST NOT include a colon.  An empty header value indicates absense
of a user name.  The header value holds precisely one value with
the following ABNF grammar:
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
User-View = 0*( unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims )
]]></artwork></figure>
The referenced non-terminals are as for URIs <xref target="RFC3986"/>.</t>

<t>The User-View header MAY occur in requests and responses, but
MUST NOT be included in trailers [Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC7230"/>].</t>

</section>


<section title="Protocol Handling of User-View" anchor="protocol">

<t>User agents SHOULD render user names in authority sections as they
do host names.  User agents SHOULD NOT remove user names from the URI.
User agents MAY remove the "@" symbol (U+0040) from a URI when the
preceding user name is empty.  User agents SHOULD indicate deprecation
of the form "user:password" and MUST NOT complain in any way about a
user name that adheres to the above grammar.</t>

<t>HTTP servers SHOULD NOT use the User-View in responses except when
responding to a user agent known to support it, possibly because they
sent the User-View header in a request.</t>

<t>When the User-View header is included in a response, it declares
that any references relative to the resource returned should consider
the returned user name part of the origin of the relative reference
[Section 4.2 of <xref target="RFC3986"/>], inasfar as no authority
information is provided in the relative reference.</t>

<t>An empty User-View header value in a response indicates absense
of a user name, due to removal relative to a request.  User agents
receiving a User-View as part of an HTTP redirect
[Section 6.4 of <xref target="RFC7231"/>]
MUST update the
user name in the URI accordingly when the authority part of the URI
is not replaced as part of a new URI location.</t>

<t>HTTP servers MAY redirect a request to a location that encodes the
user name in the path of the URI, possibly setting the User-View header
to an empty value.  This allows sites to define their own path syntax
for user names, without users or tools needing to be aware of such
local conventions.</t>

<t>Whether a User-View header is used after a redirect, and what value
it has, is determined by the target URI after its construction from
the redirection and, possibly, the previous target URI.  This means
that the User-View header MUST NOT be carried from a redirection
response to its follow-up request, but instead freshly constructed.</t>

<t>Intermediates MUST NOT add, remove or modify the User-View header.</t>

</section>

<section title="Caching Behaviour" anchor="cache">

<t>The privacy or security of an HTTP resource does not change if it
uses an additional User-View header.  This is because the header
addresses a resource location, but is independent of authentication
or authorisation, for which other headers are in use.</t>

<t>HTTP caches <xref target="RFC7234"/>
need to distinguish responses when they are requested with different
User-View header values.  To this end, the Vary header
[Section 7.1.4 of <xref target="RFC7231"/>] MUST be present, and
MUST either be valued "*" or include the "user-view" token, for any
response that has been influenced by a User-View header.  Software
or configurations that ignore the header are not under this
requirement.</t>

</section>


<section title="IANA Considerations" anchor="iana">

<t>IANA adds the following entry to the Message Headers registry:
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Header Field Name   Template   Protocol   Status    Reference
------------------  ---------  ---------  -------   ----------
User-View                      http       TBD       TBD:THIS_SPEC
]]></artwork></figure>
</t>

</section>

<section title="Security Considerations">

<t>The user names in HTTP URIs as defined herein is not related to
authentication or authorisation, and implies no security concerns.</t>

<t>These user names refine the model of resource addressing for HTTP,
but any concerns related to privacy or secrecy of resources are already
habitually addressed in HTTP servers.  This habit MUST be applied to
this new, more refined resource addressing model.</t>
